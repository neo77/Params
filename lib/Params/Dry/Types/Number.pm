=head1 NAME

Params::Dry::Types::Number - Build-in numeric types for Params::Dry - Simple Global Params Management System which helps you to keep always DRY rule

=head1 VERSION

version 1.10.01

=head1 BUILD IN TYPES

=over 4

=item * B<Number::Int> - can be used with parameters (like: Number::Int[3]) which mean max 3 chars int not counting signs

=item * B<Number::Float> - number with decimal part, full length is counted with dot separator, but decimal part not, so you can use it with parameters Number::Float[5,2] which will mean max 5 chars with two decimal point digits (12.42 - ok, 145.44 - wrong, 13.333 - wrong)

=item * B<Number::Bool> - boolean value (can be 0 or 1)
